youtube rigging tutorial i followed to rig the shuck model

models are imported into blender and exported after animating useing the three.js exporter which can be found here 

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/utils/exporters/blender

the tutorial here shows how it all works and has the three.js settings that i used to export the images

(wierd little thing that caught me out if your models are being distored when displayed in aframe make sure you have exported them in the pose they were originally rigged in otherwise it seems to start it in a posed position then pose from those points i think)

<u>io_three</u>
exporters/io_three is the three.js exporter for blender this is not supported now and a copy is kept here as it can be useful for some experiments of mine
